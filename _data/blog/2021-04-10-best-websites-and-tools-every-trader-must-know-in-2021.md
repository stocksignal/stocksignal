I have made a list of best websites which will surely help you to get the knowledge you require for trading and investing. And some websites are helpful in learning about a particular company or stock.

Most of these below mentioned websites are chosen based upon their user experience and content. A best website with all the information but filled with so many ads that you doubt whether its ads inside website or website inside ads (ahem.. moneycontrol ahem..) is of no use.

# 1. Screener.in

Probably everyone must have heard about this one. It is one of the best Stock analysis and screening tool for investors in India. It is free and with no ads.

Get automatic updates for insider trades such as promoter buying and selling in your news feed and much more.
